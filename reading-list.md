I have just started reading books after 12 years of not
knowing where the power button was. Here is what I recommend:

1. *A Fine Mess: A Global Quest for a Simpler, Fairer, and More Efficient Tax System* by T.R. Reid
2. *The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care* by T.R. Reid
3. *Preventing Regulatory Capture: Special Interest Influence and How to Limit it* by David A. Moss and Daniel Carpenter
