<p align = "left">Functions, defined as a table that maps an input to an output, are an enormous foundation of mathematics.</p>

<p align = "left">If you have ever taken a math class, you have probably seen a function that
utilizes elementary operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication,
division, and exponents. Examples include <code>f(x) = x</code>, <code>f(x) = x<sup>2</sup></code>, and <code>f(x) = e<sup>x</sup></code>.</p>

<p align = "left">If you have ever taken a computer science class, you have probably
seen a range of bitwise operations such as <code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>xor</code>.</p>

<p align = "left">But whatever these functions are, we have been able to figure out that their inverses. In laymen's terms, we have been able to reach an input from a particular output.
For example, we can figure out that the inverse function of <code>f(x) = x<sup>2</sup></code> is <code>f(x) = x<sup>1/2</sup></code>
or that the inverse function of <code>f(x) = e<sup>x</sup></code> is <code>f(x) = ln(x)</code> through simple mathematical manipulations.</p>

<p align = "left">But why am I telling you this rudimentary information?
In other words, why am I giving a seventh grade math lesson in the About section of this blog? Because the National Security Agency, an
agency that has eroded personal privacy since the signing of the PATRIOT Act, has created the
<strong>Secure Hash Algorithm</strong>. The probability of a planet outside of the solar system colliding into Earth and killing all life is higher than that
of calculating the inverse of a function like SHA-256, a <strong>Secure Hash Algorithm</strong>.</p>

<p align = "left">Let me give you an example.</p>

<p align = "left">SHA-256 maps <code>"hell"</code> to <code>0ebdc3317b75839f643387d783535adc360ca01f33c75f7c1e7373adcd675c0b</code>, but if you change one letter, SHA-256 maps <code>"help"</code> to <code>106a5842fc5fce6f663176285ed1516dbb1e3d15c05abab12fdca46d60b539b7</code> and
maps <code>"hall"</code> to <code>3cbaeb57c64020ee4df47e9274d1d0d90f3148a3c14af8190006fa680fb10ebd</code>.</p>

<p align = "left">I have tried to calculate the inverse of this
function for reasons concerning cryptocurrencies and I know it will not happen because
of the complexities that stem from the simple rules concerning various arithmetic and bitwise operations. Tens of thousands
of variables that are used in the SHA-256 function are heavily interconnected with each other meaning tampering with one
of those variables drastically effects every other variables, resembling a cat's cradle bigger than any of its kind
in the Guinness World Records, assuming there is one.</p>

<p align = "left">And for the most part, the NSA did not create such a function without inspiration. The simple rules
of quarks and gluons and other subatomic particles lead to the creation of
complex outcomes in physics and then even more complex outcomes in chemistry and then wildly complex behaviors in biology and
then the shitshow of human nature concerning the roles of our political/economic/social institutions. Could it have been
the case that the nature of the Big Bang and its creation and the subsequent externalities of an event led to my writing
and constantly editing this About page for grammatical and structural errors? If that event of writing and editing happened,
then yes, but how exactly would take our entire population millions of generations to figure out.</p>

<p align = "left">In this blog, I want to try to unwind the cat's cradle of our existence and our institutions, and I know I won't
be successful due to the shear number of entanglements present in such a cradle, but it is worth a shot, and a shot
I'll be willing to take. And I want to challenge you guys to unwind the cat's cradle with me, posing arguments that
can unwind the complex cradle faster or point out that I am unnecessarily overcomplicating the behemoth. Because
if we were put on this planet and faced with the harsh realities of our surroundings with lots of questions and little answers,
we have to at least use our tools to find answers we may definately not like and answers that will surface more questions into
existence and thus enlarge the size of our perception of the cat's cradle.</p>
